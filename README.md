The main task is to predict the price of a house based on various characteristics of houses. First, I did an exploratory analysis of the data. After processing the data, I tried a linear regression model with the default parameters and found an overfitting, so this model does not work for us. To reduce overfitting, I used L1, L2 regularization (ElasticNet). I also used cross-validation to select the optimal hyperparameters. As a result, I managed to improve the model's results. Then I tried other models such as polynomial regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. The best models in my work comparing the rmse metric to the validation metric are ElasticNet, found by searching for hyperparameters, RandomForest, and GradientBoostingRegressor.
